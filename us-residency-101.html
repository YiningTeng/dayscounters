                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Substantial Presence Test</h2>
        <p>To qualify as a resident alien under this test, you must meet the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be physically present in the US for at least 31 days in the current year, and</li>
            <li>Be physically present for at least 183 days over a 3-year period, calculated as:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>All days in the current year.</li>
                <li>1/3 of the days in the previous year.</li>
                <li>1/6 of the days in the year before that.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Exceptions exist for students, diplomats, and individuals with closer connections to another country.</p>

        <h2>Permanent Residents (Green Card Holders)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Green card holders have lawful permanent residency and can live and work in the US indefinitely.</li>
            <li>Green card status can be lost if the holder resides outside the US for extended periods without obtaining a reentry permit.</li>
            <li>Must comply with US tax laws, reporting worldwide income annually.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>US Citizenship</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Citizenship provides full legal rights, including voting and obtaining a US passport.</li>
            <li>Naturalized citizens must meet residency requirements before applying, such as being a permanent resident for at least 5 years (or 3 years for spouses of US citizens).</li>
            <li>Citizens are not restricted by the substantial presence test or green card validity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tax Implications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Worldwide Taxation:</strong> US residents and citizens must report income earned both domestically and internationally.</li>
            <li><strong>Filing Forms:</strong> Common forms include the 1040 for residents and the 1040-NR for nonresidents.</li>
            <li><strong>Tax Treaties:</strong> The US has tax treaties with many countries to prevent double taxation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <h3>Example 1: Substantial Presence Test</h3>
        <p>If you spent 120 days in the US in 2025, 120 days in 2024, and 120 days in 2023, the calculation would be:</p>
        <p>
            <strong>2025:</strong> 120 days<br>
            <strong>2024:</strong> 120 × 1/3 = 40 days<br>
            <strong>2023:</strong> 120 × 1/6 = 20 days<br>
            <strong>Total:</strong> 180 days (Not a resident).
        </p>
        <h3>Example 2: Dual Citizenship</h3>
        <p>A US citizen with Canadian citizenship must file US taxes on global income but may qualify for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE).</p>
