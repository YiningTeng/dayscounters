        <h1>US Residency 101</h1>
        <p>Understanding U.S. residency and tax status is crucial for individuals living or working in the U.S. This guide explains the different types of residency, tax obligations, and how to calculate days spent in the U.S. for residency and citizenship purposes.</p>

        <h2>Types of U.S. Residency</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lawful Permanent Resident (Green Card Holder)</strong> - You are considered a U.S. resident for tax purposes and must file a U.S. tax return annually.</li>
            <li><strong>Substantial Presence Test</strong> - If you spend 183 days or more in the U.S. over a 3-year period, you may be considered a U.S. resident for tax purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Resident Alien</strong> - If you do not meet the substantial presence test, you are considered a non-resident alien and have different tax obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Substantial Presence Test</h2>
        <p>The Substantial Presence Test is used to determine if you are a U.S. resident for tax purposes. To meet the test, you must be physically present in the U.S. for at least:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>31 days</strong> during the current year, and</li>
            <li><strong>183 days</strong> during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The formula for calculating the 183-day threshold is:</p>
        <div class="example">
            <h4>Substantial Presence Test Formula</h4>
            <p>Total Days = (All days in the current year) + (1/3 of days in the first year before) + (1/6 of days in the second year before)</p>
            <p>If the total is 183 or more, you meet the test.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <div class="example">
            <h4>Substantial Presence Test Calculation</h4>
            <p>If you spent the following days in the U.S.:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2023: 120 days</li>
                <li>2024: 100 days</li>
                <li>2025: 80 days</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your total days would be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2025: 80 days × 1 = 80</li>
                <li>2024: 100 days × 1/3 = 33.33</li>
                <li>2023: 120 days × 1/6 = 20</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Total: 80 + 33.33 + 20 = <strong>133.33 days</strong>. Since this is less than 183, you do not meet the substantial presence test.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Tax Obligations for U.S. Residents</h2>
        <p>If you are considered a U.S. resident for tax purposes, you must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>File a U.S. federal tax return annually.</li>
            <li>Report worldwide income, including income earned outside the U.S.</li>
            <li>Pay taxes on your income, including wages, investments, and business income.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <div class="example">
            <h4>Tax Filing for Green Card Holders</h4>
            <p>If you are a Green Card holder living in the U.S., you must file Form 1040 (U.S. Individual Income Tax Return) and report your worldwide income, even if you earn income abroad.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Non-Resident Alien Tax Obligations</h2>
        <p>If you are a non-resident alien, you are generally taxed only on income from U.S. sources. Common tax forms for non-residents include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Form 1040-NR</strong> - U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return.</li>
            <li><strong>Form W-8BEN</strong> - Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for U.S. Tax Withholding.</li>
        </ul>
